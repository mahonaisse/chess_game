# Chess: The Game

## Description 
Chess is one of the oldest and most popular board games. Two people can play against each other, first choosing between the black or white side, then taking turns to move one of their pieces according to that piece's fixed rules. The game continues until a player's King piece is [checkmated](https://www.chess.com/terms/check-chess#:~:text=When%20a%20king%20is%20attacked,must%20get%20out%20of%20check!) or can no longer move out of harm of an opposing piece(s).

We wanted to create Chess because it is a simple, yet complex game. None of the information of the game is hidden at any time, so Chess becomes a game of strategic planning and improvisation. Trying to create such a game sounds exciting, and implementing more 'game' features, such as saving or loading a game, undoing a player's move, or playing against a computer, sound like a challenge and a great way for us to improve as programmers.

The inputs of the project will include navigational inputs for navigating the menu and selecting options from the menu. Additionally, the user will need to input their moves for the game. Outputs will include listing the menu options, and a way to visualize the chess board. Whether that be through ASCII art, a Python library, a C++ library, or something else entirely, we are not sure yet.

 > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include:
 > * ~~Why is it important or interesting to you?~~ (already answered)
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 (C++ definitely, if yall could please expand on how we'd use Python, that'd be great)
 > * ~~What will be the input/output of your project? 
 (possibly expand from Python, otherwise a simple ascii board with an input line for moves/features)~~
 > * What are the features that the project provides?
 > This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. (game saving/loading, undoing movings, playing with computer, anything else is great)
 > 
 > ~~You also need to set up an empty project board using GitHub projects (board view). Make sure you add the board under your project repository. You should also have a Product Backlog and In testing columns added.~~ (i have done this -mario)
 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to:
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
 > * Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots during your lab on week 6. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
 >   * The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
 >   * The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
 >     * The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
 >     * How work will be divided between the team members
## Class Diagram
 > Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase I.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
> 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
